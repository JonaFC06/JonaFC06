## Hi there 👋

I'm Jonathan Fuentes, an Engineering Physics and Telecommunications student from Costa Rica with a strong interest in Data Science, Data Analytics, and backend development applied to scientific and engineering problems.

I have experience working with Python-based data analysis, experimental data acquisition, and scientific instrumentation. My projects include designing ESP32-based data acquisition systems, analyzing environmental and spectrophotometric data, and applying statistical and data-driven techniques to real-world experiments.

I enjoy working at the intersection of physics, programming, and data, and I'm motivated to apply these skills in international research and technology-driven environments.

📌 Areas of interest:
- Data Science & Data Analytics  
- Scientific Computing  
- Backend Development  
- Embedded Systems & IoT  

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn)  
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL  
- Django, Flask  
- ESP32, sensor data acquisition  
- Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Linux (basic)
