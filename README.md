## Hi there 👋

I'm Jonathan, a Engineering Physics and Telecommunications student with a strong interest in data science, backend development, and embedded systems.

I enjoy working on projects that combine physics, programming, and real-world applications — from data analysis and backend services to ESP32-based IoT systems.

Currently, I'm strengthening my skills in Python, SQL, and backend frameworks, while exploring how data-driven solutions can be applied to engineering and scientific problems.

📌 Areas of interest:
- Data Science & Data Analysis  
- Backend Development  
- Embedded Systems & IoT  
- Scientific Computing  

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python, SQL  
- Django / Flask  
- ESP32, Arduino  
- Git & Linux
